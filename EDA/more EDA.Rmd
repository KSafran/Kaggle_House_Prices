```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

## Set Up and Data Load

```{r data load, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
setwd("C:/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Kaggle/Kaggle_House_Prices")
train <- fread('Data/train.csv')
```
## Neighborhoods

Neighborhood is another obvious factor in home price.
```{r}
price.order <- train %>% 
  group_by(Neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(price = mean(SalePrice)) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(price)
train$neighborhood <- factor(train$Neighborhood, levels = price.order$Neighborhood)
train %>% 
  filter(SaleCondition == 'Normal') %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = GrLivArea, y = log(SalePrice))) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = GrLivArea, y = log(SalePrice))) +
  facet_wrap(~neighborhood) +
  theme_bw()
```
